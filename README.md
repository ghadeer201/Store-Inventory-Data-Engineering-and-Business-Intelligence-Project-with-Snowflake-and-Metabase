# Store-Inventory-Data-Engineering-and-Business-Intelligence-Project-with-Snowflake-and-Metabase
The project focused on Analytical Data Engineering for an online and retail store. It
involved the ingestion of data from various sources and its loading into the
Snowflake data warehouse. The data then underwent a series of transformation
processes within the warehouse to prepare it for Business Intelligence (BI) usage.
The BI tool Metabase was used to connect to the data warehouse and generate
diverse dashboards and reports.
